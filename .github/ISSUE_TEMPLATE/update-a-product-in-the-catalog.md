**As a** Product Manager  
**I need** the ability to update a product in the catalog  
**So that** I can make changes to product details as needed.  

### Details and Assumptions
* Updates should include editing fields such as price, description, and availability.  
* Change history should be maintained for audit purposes.

### Acceptance Criteria  
```gherkin
Given a user with product update permissions,
When they modify the product details and save the changes,
Then the updated product information should be reflected in the catalog.

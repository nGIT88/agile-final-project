**As a** System Administrator  
**I need** the catalog to be hosted in the cloud  
**So that** it can scale efficiently and be accessible from anywhere.  

### Details and Assumptions
* The hosting provider must support high availability and redundancy.  
* Security measures should be implemented for data protection.

### Acceptance Criteria  
```gherkin
Given the catalog application is deployed,
When users access the catalog from different locations,
Then they should be able to access it without issues.
